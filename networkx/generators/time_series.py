def visibility_graph(series):
    """
    Return a Visibility Graph of an input Time Series.

    It converts a time series into a graph. The constructed graph inherits several properties of the series in its
    structure. Thereby, periodic series convert into regular graphs, and random series do so into random graphs.
    Moreover, fractal series convert into scale-free networks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series: list[float] | tuple[float] | list[int] | tuple[int]
       Time Series iterable of float or int values

    Returns
    -------
    NetworkX Graph
        The Visibility Graph of the input series

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from matplotlib import pyplot
    >>>
    >>> series_list = [range(10), [2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3]]
    >>>
    >>> for s in series_list:
    ...     g = nx.visibility_graph(s)
    ...     print(g)
    ...     # Uncomment to following lines to plot the Graph.
    ...     # pos = [[x, 0] for x in range(len(s))]
    ...     # labels = nx.get_node_attributes(g, 'value')
    ...     # nx.draw_networkx_nodes(g, pos)
